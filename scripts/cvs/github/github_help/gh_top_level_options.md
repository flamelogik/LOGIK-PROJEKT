# GitHub CLI (gh) Top-Level Options (Flags)

These are the top-level flags that can be used with the `gh` command, affecting its overall behavior.

```
FLAGS
  --help      Show help for command
  --version   Show gh version
```

**Explanation:**

*   `--help`: Displays help information for the command it's used with. When used with just `gh`, it shows general help and a list of core commands.
*   `--version`: Prints the installed version of the GitHub CLI.

Note that most `gh` subcommands (like `gh issue`, `gh pr`, `gh repo`) have their own specific flags and options, which can be viewed by running `gh <command> --help` (e.g., `gh issue --help`).
