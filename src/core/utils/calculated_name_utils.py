    To change the naming convention, please follow these steps:
    1. Choose ONE of the "RECIPE" options below.
    2. Make sure the line for your chosen recipe starts with
    "calculated_name =".
    3. To disable a recipe, add a '#' at the beginning of its line.
    4. Make sure only ONE "calculated_name =" line is active (not commented out).
