Main operation mode: 
    -a, --archive [session_name]
                    archive clips to a file archive.  The selected entries
                    are grouped under an archive session.  The default
                    session name is "Archive Session - <date>".  This can
                    be overridden by specifying 'session_name'.
    -r, --restore   restore clips from a file archive.
    -l, --list      list dump of archive file or clips.
    -f, --format    format an archive file.
    -e, --estimate  estimate space of clips when archiving and restoring.
    -c, --convert   convert file archive to current format.

Operation modifiers: 

  To identify an archive (and a specific entry within that archive): 
    -F, --file      <ARCHIVE_FILE_PATH> 
    -S, --source    <PATH_TO_ENTRY_IN_ARCHIVE> 

  To identify a project (and a specific entry within that project): 
    -P, --project   <PROJECT_NAME> 
    -W, --workspace <WORKSPACE_NAME> 
    -L, --library   <LIBRARY_NAME> 
    -E, --entry     <ENTRY_PATH_IN_PROJECT> or <WIRETAP_PATH_IN_PROJET> 
    -B, --batch     <PATH_TO_FILE > 

    When using the -S or -E path option, you can separate the entry names 
    of a hierarchy with a '/' character.  If a name contains a '/', you can 
    escape the character by using a '\\' in front of the '/' so it does not 
    get confused with an entry separator.  Similarly, if the name contains a space, 
    the space can be escaped with a single '\' 

    You can also use the '@' symbol to specify a UID for any entry. 
    An entry with a matching UID will be searched recursively from  
    the current path location.  A UID may be used at the begining of 
    the path, for a global search, or after specifying a few entry levels 
    using the '/' separator, in order to refine the UID search. 

  Here are some examples of possibile modifiers used to locate an entry, 
  using a path within an archive or project: 
      -P pjr1                                                # project prj1 
      -P prj1 -W workspace -L mylib                          # clip library 
      -P prj1 -E /workspace/myLib                            # idem 
      -P prj1 -L mySharedlib                                 # Shared library 
      -P pro1 -E @H_-15183_U_771516                          # recursive search of UID in project 
      -P pro1 -E /workspace/Desktop/Reels@H_-15183_U_771516  # recursive search of UID in reels 
      -F /tmp/myArchive                                      # archive 
      -F /tmp/myArchive -S @H_-15183_U_771516                # recursive search of UID in archive 
      -P prj1 -E '/Date\ :\ 2015\\/21\\/12/Folder2'          # using the '\\' escape sequence 
                                                             # in front of the date '/' characters and 
                                                             # a single '\' in front of spaces, for a 

    When using -B, you must specify a file containing a list of UIDs starting by @. or a 
    Wiretap path. The entries must be provided one by line. 

Options: 
    -A,  --archiveLibrary <PATH>, use PATH as the directory path for the archive library where TOC files are stored 
    -u, --displayuid with -l, display the UID when listing 
    -n, --name <NAME> with -f, use NAME as the name of archive when formatting, default is 'Archive' 
    -t, --comment <TEXT> with -f, use TEXT as the comment when formatting, can be omitted

    -O, --omit <LIST>
        <LIST> is a comma-separated list of at least one of the following:
            sources : do not include source caches in archive (only relevant with --linked)
            renders : do not include TimelineFX renders in archive
            maps : do not include maps and ML cache in archive
            unused : like 'sources' but applied to unused versions only
