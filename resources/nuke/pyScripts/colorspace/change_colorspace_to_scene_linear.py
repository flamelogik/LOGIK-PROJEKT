    Change the colorspace of selected 'Read' nodes in Nuke to 'scene_linear'.
    This function iterates through all currently selected nodes in Nuke,
    checks if they are of the class 'Read', and sets their colorspace to 'scene_linear'.
    It also optionally refreshes the Nuke GUI to reflect the changes.
    Usage:
        Select the 'Read' nodes in Nuke that you want to change the colorspace for,
        then run this function.
    Note:
        This script is intended to be used within the Nuke environment.
