## Your Control Panel: The Main Window Explained

When you open LOGIK-PROJEKT, you'll see a window divided into two main sections:

*   **Left Side (Your "Template" Input):** This is where you tell LOGIK-PROJEKT all the details about your new projekt.
*   **Right Side (Your "Projekt & Flame Options Checklist" & Options):** This lets you load existing setups, modify Autodesk Flame options and check youur projekt summary, before creating your projekt.

Let's walk through it!

### Left Side: Filling Out Your Projekt Brief

This is where you define your projekt's identity information and technical parameters.

#### 1. Template Info (Top Left Panel)

This is like the basic info on your projekt brief – who it's for, what it's called.

*   **Serial Number:** A unique ID for this projekt. Sometimes it's automatically generated, sometimes you'll type it in (e.g., "001", "PROJ_005").
*   **Client Name:** The company or client you're doing the work for (e.g., "Nike", "Coca-Cola").
*   **Campaign Name:** The specific campaign or job title (e.g., "Summer Shoes 2025", "Holiday Commercial").
*   **Projekt Name:** This usually combines the above into a clear, organized name for your projekt folder and Flame projekt (e.g., "001_Nike_SummerShoes2025").
*   **Description:** A short note about the projekt – what's the main goal?

#### 2. Template Parameters (Middle Left Panel)

This is where you input the technical specifications for your projekt, often provided by your producer or creative director.

*   **Resolution:** The size of your video frame (e.g., "HD 1920x1080", "UHD 3840x2160"). Just pick from the list!
*   **Bit Depth:** How much color information your video will have (e.g., "8-bit", "10-bit", "16-bit Float"). Higher is usually better for quality, but uses more space.
*   **Frame Rate:** How many frames per second your video will play at (e.g., "23.976 fps" for film, "29.97 fps" for broadcast).
*   **Scan Mode:** A technical setting for how the video is displayed (e.g., "Progressive", "Interlaced").
*   **Start Frame:** The first frame number of your projekt (often 1 or 1001).
*   **Init Config:** A specific Flame initialization setting.
*   **OCIO Config:** This is for color management. If you're not sure, stick with the default or ask your supervisor.
*   **Cache Integer / Cache Float:** These relate to how Flame manages its temporary files for performance.

#### 3. Template Summary (Bottom Left Panel)

This is your "Review & Save" section. It shows you *all* the details you've entered, neatly organized.

*   **Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template button (optional step):** This is super useful if you want to immediately share a LOGIK-PROJEKT template with other artists/producers who may be on different networks.

### Right Side: Your Production Checklist & Flame Integration

This side helps you manage existing projekt setups and integrate with Flame.

#### 1. Projekt Template (Top Right Panel)

This is where you can load a projekt setup that's already been defined.

*   **Import LOGIK-PROJEKT Template button:** Click this if you have a LOGIK-PROJEKT template from another artist/producer/company. It will automatically fill in all the settings on the left side, saving you tons of time!

#### 2. Flame Options (Middle Right Panel)

Here, you tell LOGIK-PROJEKT about your Autodesk Flame installation.

*   **Software Version:** Select the version of Flame you'll be using for this projekt (e.g., "Flame 2025").
*   **Flame Home Dir / Setups Dir / Media Dir / Catalog Dir:** These are the main locations where Flame stores its important files and media.
*   **LOGIK-PROJEKT Config:** Select the default LOGIK-PROJEKT settings or choose a custom config.

#### 3. Projekt Summary (Bottom Right Panel)

This is your final "All Systems Go!" checklist. It pulls together *everything* – your projekt details, technical specs, Flame settings, and even some info about your computer – to show you exactly what your new projekt will look like before it's created.

*   **Current User / Workstation / OS:** Just some basic info about who's using the app and on what machine.
*   **Flame Software / Projekt details:** All the settings you've chosen for your Flame projekt, summarized.
*   **LOGIK-PROJEKT Name / Path:** This tells you the exact name of your new projekt folder and where it will be created on your computer's hard drive.
*   **Create PROJEKT button:** This is the big one! Once you've reviewed everything and it looks correct, click this button. LOGIK-PROJEKT will then:
    *   Create all the necessary projekt folders on your computer.
    *   Set up a new projekt within Autodesk Flame with all your specified settings.
    *   It might even ask if you want to launch Flame directly into your new projekt!

## Quick Tips for Success!

*   **Always Check the Summary:** Before hitting "Create PROJEKT," quickly scan the "Projekt Summary" panel. It's your last chance to catch any mistakes!
*   **Always Check the LOGIK-PROJEKT Config:** Make sure you're using the correct config!
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask:** If a setting or a term doesn't make sense, ask your senior artist, producer, or technical director. It's better to ask than to set up a projekt incorrectly!
*   **Validation is Your Safety Net:** LOGIK-PROJEKT has some built-in checks. If something isn't quite right, it will often give you a warning message. Pay attention to these!

LOGIK-PROJEKT is designed to make your life easier and your projekts more organized. Use it to your advantage and focus on the creative work you love!
