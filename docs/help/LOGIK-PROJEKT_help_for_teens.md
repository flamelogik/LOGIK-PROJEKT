# LOGIK-PROJEKT: Your Creative Project Sidekick!

Hey there! So, you've opened up LOGIK-PROJEKT, and you might be wondering, "What even *is* this thing?" Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it looks! Think of it as your personal assistant for setting up big creative projects, especially if you're working with something called Autodesk Flame (it's a fancy video editing and effects program).

## What is LOGIK-PROJEKT?

Imagine you're building a super cool LEGO castle. You need all the right pieces, organized perfectly, and a clear plan. LOGIK-PROJEKT does that for your digital projects. It helps you:

*   **Organize your files:** It creates all the right folders on your computer so you don't have to guess where things go.
*   **Set up your Flame projects:** It gets Flame ready with all the correct settings (like screen size, colors, and how fast your video plays).
*   **Keep everything tidy:** It makes sure your computer files and your Flame project files are linked up, so you never lose track of anything.

Basically, it takes all the boring, technical setup stuff off your plate so you can jump straight into being creative!

## Getting Started: The Main Window

When you open LOGIK-PROJEKT, you'll see a window with a few different sections. Don't get overwhelmed! It's designed to guide you step-by-step.

On the **left side**, you'll be telling the app about your *new project idea*.
On the **right side**, you'll see a *summary* of what your project will look like, and some options for how Flame will work.

Let's break down the main parts:

### Left Side: Building Your New Project Idea

This is where you input all the details for your new project.

#### 1. Template Info (Top Left)

This is like giving your project a name and a quick description.

*   **Serial Number:** A unique ID for your project. Sometimes it's automatic, sometimes you type it in.
*   **Client Name:** Who are you making this for? (e.g., "Cool Shoes Company")
*   **Campaign Name:** What's the project called? (e.g., "Summer Sneaker Ad")
*   **Projekt Name:** This usually fills itself in based on the above. It's the main name for your project.
*   **Description:** A short note about what this project is all about.

#### 2. Template Parameters (Middle Left)

This is where you tell the app about the technical details of your video or animation. Don't worry if some of these sound complicated â€“ just pick from the lists!

*   **Resolution:** How big your video picture will be (like 1920x1080 for Full HD).
*   **Bit Depth:** How many colors your video can show (higher is better, but takes up more space).
*   **Frame Rate:** How many pictures per second your video has (like 24 for movies, 30 for TV).
*   **Scan Mode:** A technical setting for how the video picture is drawn.
*   **Start Frame:** What number your video starts counting from (usually 1 or 1001).
*   **Init Config:** A special setup file for Flame.
*   **OCIO Config:** This is about color management. If you're not a color scientist, just pick the default!
*   **Cache Integer / Cache Float:** These are about how Flame stores temporary files to work faster.

#### 3. Template Summary (Bottom Left)

This section is your "review before you save" area. It shows you *all* the information you've entered above, neatly organized. This is what will be saved as your "template" if you decide to export it.

*   **Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template button:** If you've set up a perfect project and want to use these settings again for future projects, click this button to save it as a template file.

### Right Side: Your Project's Current Status & Options

This side gives you an overview and lets you pick some final settings.

#### 1. Projekt Template (Top Right)

This is where you can load a project setup you saved before, or one someone else gave you.

*   **Import LOGIK-PROJEKT Template button:** Click this if you want to load a template file you've already saved (or someone else shared with you). It will fill in all the settings on the left side automatically!

#### 2. Flame Options (Middle Right)

Here, you tell the app about your Autodesk Flame program.

*   **Software Version:** Which version of Flame are you using?
*   **Flame Home Dir / Setups Dir / Media Dir / Catalog Dir:** These are important folders where Flame keeps its stuff. You might need to tell the app where your Flame program is installed, and it will usually figure out the rest.
*   **PROJEKT Config:** A special setting for how LOGIK-PROJEKT itself is set up.

#### 3. Projekt Summary (Bottom Right)

This is the grand overview! It pulls together *everything* you've entered and selected, plus some info about your computer, to show you exactly what your new project will look like.

*   **Current User / Workstation / OS:** Just some info about who's using the app and on what computer.
*   **Flame Software / Projekt details:** All the settings you picked for Flame and your project, summarized.
*   **LOGIK-PROJEKT Name / Path:** This tells you what your new project will be called and where it will be created on your computer.
*   **Create PROJEKT button:** This is the big one! Once everything looks good, click this to make all the folders and set up your Flame project. It might even ask if you want to open Flame right away!

## Common Questions & Tips

*   **"My 'Projekt Name' isn't changing!"** Make sure you've typed something into the "Serial Number," "Client Name," and "Campaign Name" fields. It usually needs all three to create the full name.
*   **"I clicked 'Create PROJEKT' but nothing happened!"** Check the "Projekt Summary" panel. There might be a warning message telling you something needs to be fixed (like a missing folder path).
*   **"What's a 'template'?"** It's like a recipe! You set up all your favorite project settings once, save it as a template, and then you can use that recipe to quickly create new projects with the same settings over and over again.
*   **"I don't understand a setting!"** If you're not sure about a technical setting (like "OCIO Config"), it's usually safe to leave it as the default or ask someone more experienced. LOGIK-PROJEKT tries to pick smart defaults for you.
*   **"Where do my projects go?"** Look at the "LOGIK-PROJEKT Path" in the "Projekt Summary" panel. That's where your new project folder will be created on your computer.

You've got this! LOGIK-PROJEKT is here to make your creative life easier, not harder. Just take it one step at a time, and don't be afraid to experiment (you can always delete a test project if it doesn't work out!).
