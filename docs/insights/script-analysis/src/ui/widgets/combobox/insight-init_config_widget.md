# Insight: `init_config_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`InitConfigWidget` is a composite `QWidget` containing a `QLabel` and a `QComboBox`. It functions as a dropdown menu for selecting a configuration file.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to select an `init.cfg` file. In Autodesk Flame, the `init.cfg` file is a powerful script that runs at application startup, allowing for the customization of the environment, paths, and other settings. This selection determines which initial configuration the new project will use when launched.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Dynamic Population:** The list of available `init.cfg` files is populated dynamically via the `set_values(values)` method. An external process must scan the system for these files.
- **Default Selection:** The first item in the populated list is selected by default.
- **Simple Value Access:** The `get()` method returns the name of the selected `init.cfg` file as a string, and `set(value)` allows for programmatic selection.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Init Config:".
- `self.combobox`: The `QComboBox` that displays the list of available `init.cfg` files.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QComboBox` emits the `currentTextChanged(const QString &)` signal when the user makes a selection.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `set_values(self, values)`: Populates the dropdown with a list of strings.
  - `get(self)`: Retrieves the selected configuration file name.
  - `set(self, value)`: Sets the current selection.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` for the `COMBOBOX_HEIGHT` constant.
- **External File Scanner**: This widget is critically dependent on a utility script (likely within `src.core.utils`) that scans the user's Flame preferences directory to find all available `init.cfg` files.
- **Relationship to Project Launch Scripts**: The value selected here is used by the project creation logic to generate the final startup script for the Flame project. The script will be configured to launch Flame with the chosen `init.cfg` file, ensuring the correct environment is loaded.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This widget makes it easy for a user to switch between different Flame environments without needing to know the exact location of the `init.cfg` files. By populating the list from the filesystem, it guarantees that only valid, existing configurations can be selected, which is a robust error-prevention strategy.
