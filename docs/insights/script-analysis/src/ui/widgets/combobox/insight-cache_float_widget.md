# Insight: `cache_float_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`CacheFloatWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that pairs a `QLabel` with a `QComboBox`. It is designed for selecting a specific technical format from a predefined list.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to select the compression format for the floating-point media cache within Autodesk Flame. This setting impacts performance and disk space usage.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

This widget has a more advanced implementation than a simple text-based combobox:

- **Data-Driven Population:** The `set_values(values)` method populates the dropdown from a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary must contain a `"format"` key (the human-readable text, e.g., "16-bit fp Uncompressed") and a `"code"` key (an internal, non-visible identifier).
- **Separation of Display and Data:** It uses the `addItem(text, data)` feature of `QComboBox`. The user sees the `format` string, but the application logic primarily interacts with the associated `code`.
- **Value Retrieval:** The `get()` method returns the `currentData()`, which is the `code` associated with the selected item, not the visible text.
- **Value Setting:** The `set(value)` method takes a `code` as an argument. It then searches for the item associated with that data and sets it as the current selection.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Cache Float:".
- `self.combobox`: The `QComboBox` instance that stores and displays the cache format options.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QComboBox` (`self.combobox`) emits `currentIndexChanged(int)` and `currentTextChanged(const QString &)` signals when the user makes a selection.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `set_values(self, values)`: Populates the combobox from a list of dictionaries.
  - `get(self)`: Returns the internal `code` (data) of the currently selected item.
  - `set(self, value)`: Sets the selection based on its internal `code`.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to use the `COMBOBOX_HEIGHT` constant for visual consistency.
- **External Controller/Data Source**: The widget is dependent on a controller to provide the list of dictionaries containing the `format` and `code` pairs. This data is specific to Flame's capabilities and is managed externally.
- **Relationship to Project Configuration**: The `code` retrieved from this widget is a key piece of technical metadata that will be used by the project creation logic to configure the Flame project correctly.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This widget provides an excellent example of abstracting technical details. The user is presented with a clean, descriptive list of options (e.g., "16-bit fp Compressed"). The underlying system, however, works with a more robust and unambiguous `code`. This separation makes the UI user-friendly while keeping the backend logic clean and reliable.
