# Insight: `bit_depth_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`BitDepthWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that contains a `QLabel` and a `QComboBox`. It functions as a selection dropdown for the project's bit depth.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to select the desired bit depth (e.g., "8-bit", "10-bit", "12-bit", "16-bit float") for the Flame project. This is a critical setting that affects color precision and file size.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Dynamic Population:** The dropdown choices are not hardcoded. They are populated dynamically by an external controller calling the `set_values(values)` method. This allows the available bit depths to be defined and managed centrally.
- **Default Selection:** When the values are set, the widget automatically selects the first item in the list (`setCurrentIndex(0)`) as the default.
- **Value Access:** The currently selected bit depth can be retrieved as a string using the `get()` method, and a specific value can be selected programmatically using the `set(value)` method.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Bit Depth:".
- `self.combobox`: The `QComboBox` instance that holds and displays the bit depth options.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QComboBox` (`self.combobox`) emits the `currentIndexChanged(int)` and `currentTextChanged(const QString &)` signals whenever the user selects a different item. These signals are essential for notifying other parts of the application about the change.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `set_values(self, values)`: A public method to clear and populate the combobox with a list of string values.
  - `get(self)`: Retrieves the currently selected text.
  - `set(self, value)`: Programmatically sets the current selection.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to use the `COMBOBOX_HEIGHT` constant, ensuring a consistent UI appearance.
- **External Controller/Data Source**: This widget is dependent on a higher-level controller (like `app_logic.py`) or a data model to provide the list of valid bit depth options. The controller is responsible for fetching these values (e.g., from a configuration file or a hardcoded list) and passing them to the `set_values()` method.
- **Relationship to Other Widgets**: The selection made in this widget is a key piece of project metadata. A parent controller will listen for its `currentTextChanged` signal to update a summary panel or store the value in the main project data model.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

Using a `QComboBox` is the standard and most intuitive way to present a fixed list of choices to a user. It prevents data entry errors that could occur with a free-text field. The dynamic population ensures that the choices presented to the user are always valid and centrally managed.
