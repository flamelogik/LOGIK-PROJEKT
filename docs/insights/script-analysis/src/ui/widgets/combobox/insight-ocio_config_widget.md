# Insight: `ocio_config_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`OcioConfigWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that combines a `QLabel` and a `QComboBox`. It is designed for selecting an OpenColorIO (OCIO) configuration.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to select a specific OCIO configuration file (`.ocio` or `.json`). OCIO configurations are crucial for consistent color management across different applications and stages of a production pipeline. The selected configuration will be applied to the new Flame project.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Dynamic Population:** The `set_values(values)` method populates the `QComboBox` with a list of OCIO configuration names. These names are typically derived from scanning a designated OCIO configurations directory.
- **Default Selection:** The first item in the populated list is set as the default selection.
- **Value Access:** The `get()` method returns the currently selected OCIO configuration name as a string. The `set(value)` method allows for programmatic selection of an OCIO configuration.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement of the label and combobox.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "OCIO Config:".
- `self.combobox`: The `QComboBox` instance that displays the list of available OCIO configurations.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QComboBox` emits the `currentTextChanged(const QString &)` signal when the user selects a new OCIO configuration. This signal is important for triggering updates in other parts of the application that might depend on the selected color space.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `set_values(self, values)`: Populates the dropdown with a list of OCIO configuration names.
  - `get(self)`: Retrieves the selected OCIO configuration name.
  - `set(self, value)`: Sets the current selection.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` for the `COMBOBOX_HEIGHT` constant, ensuring visual consistency.
- **`src.core.utils.ocio_utils` (or similar)**: This widget relies on an external utility script that scans for and provides a list of available OCIO configurations. The application logic would use this utility to gather the data and then pass it to the `set_values()` method.
- **Relationship to Project Creation Logic**: The selected OCIO configuration is a critical piece of metadata that will be used by the project creation logic to correctly set up color management within the new Flame project. This ensures that all media and processes within the project adhere to the chosen color pipeline.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

By providing a dropdown of available OCIO configurations, the widget simplifies the complex task of color management for the user. It ensures that only valid and pre-defined configurations can be selected, preventing errors and promoting consistency across projects. The dynamic population means that new OCIO configurations can be added to the system and automatically become available in the UI without code changes.
