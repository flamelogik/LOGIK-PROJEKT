# Insight: `flame_media_dir_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`FlameMediaDirWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that includes a `QLabel` and a `QPushButton`. It functions as a specialized button for selecting a directory path.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to specify the directory where Autodesk Flame media files (e.g., video, audio, images) are stored. This is crucial for the application to correctly manage and link media within Flame projects.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Directory Selection Trigger:** When the button is clicked, it emits a `clicked` signal, which is intended to be connected to a function that opens a directory selection dialog (e.g., `QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory`).
- **Path Display:** The button's text dynamically updates to display the currently selected directory path. This provides immediate visual feedback to the user.
- **Path Access:** The `get_path()` method retrieves the currently displayed path, and `set_path(path)` allows for programmatic setting of the path.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Flame Media Dir:".
- `self.button`: The `QPushButton` instance, which initially displays "Select Directory" and then the chosen path.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The `self.button` (a `QPushButton`) emits the standard `clicked()` signal when pressed.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - The `__init__` method takes an optional `command` argument. This `command` (a callable) is connected to the button's `clicked` signal, typically triggering a file dialog.
  - `set_path(self, path)`: A public method to update the button's text with the selected directory path.
  - `get_path(self)`: A public method to retrieve the currently displayed path.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`QFileDialog` (external to this widget)**: The `command` connected to this button's `clicked` signal will typically involve `QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory` to allow the user to browse and select a directory.
- **Application Logic/Configuration**: The path selected via this widget is a critical configuration setting for the application. It will be used by the project creation logic to correctly interact with Flame's media management system.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This widget provides a user-friendly way to select a directory path without requiring the user to manually type it. The dynamic updating of the button's text with the selected path provides clear and immediate feedback, enhancing usability. This pattern is commonly used for file system interactions in GUI applications.
