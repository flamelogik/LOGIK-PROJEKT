# Insight: `export_template_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`ExportTemplateWidget` is a composite `QWidget` primarily composed of a `QPushButton`. It serves as an action button for exporting project templates.

## 2. Purpose

This widget provides a user interface element to trigger the export of a LOGIK-PROJEKT template. This allows users to save their current project settings and configurations as a reusable template.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Action Trigger:** When the button is clicked, it emits a `clicked` signal. This signal is connected to a Python callable (a `command`) provided during the widget's initialization.
- **Visual Feedback:** The button has a fixed height for consistent UI and a descriptive text "Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template". It also has an object name `"exportTemplateButton"` for potential styling or identification.
- **Optional Label:** Similar to `CreateProjektWidget`, it includes an empty, fixed-width `QLabel` that could be used for future enhancements like status messages.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` that arranges the (empty) label and the button horizontally.
- `self.label`: An empty `QLabel` with a fixed width.
- `self.button`: The `QPushButton` instance with the text "Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template".

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The `self.button` (a `QPushButton`) emits the standard `clicked()` signal when pressed.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - The `__init__` method accepts an optional `command` argument. If provided, this callable (typically a method from a template management controller) is connected to the button's `clicked` signal. This is the primary mechanism for initiating the template export logic.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to set the `BUTTON_HEIGHT`, ensuring visual consistency with other buttons in the application.
- **`TemplateHandler` (or a dedicated template management controller)**: This widget is a key part of the template management workflow. The `command` passed to its constructor will typically be a method from a `TemplateHandler` class (e.g., `src/core/template_manager/template_handler.py`). This method will be responsible for:
  - Gathering the current project settings.
  - Serializing these settings into a template format (e.g., JSON).
  - Saving the template to a designated location.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This button provides a clear and intuitive way for users to save their project configurations as reusable templates. Its prominent labeling and direct connection to the export logic make the template management process straightforward. The design promotes reusability and efficiency in project setup.
