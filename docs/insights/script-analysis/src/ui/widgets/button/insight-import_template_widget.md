# Insight: `import_template_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`ImportTemplateWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that primarily contains a `QPushButton`. It serves as an action button for importing project templates.

## 2. Purpose

This widget provides a user interface element to trigger the import of a LOGIK-PROJEKT template. This allows users to load previously saved project settings and configurations, streamlining the setup of new projects.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Action Trigger:** When the button is clicked, it emits a `clicked` signal. This signal is connected to a command (a Python callable) provided during its initialization.
- **Visual Feedback:** The button has a fixed height for consistent UI and a descriptive text "Import LOGIK-PROJEKT Template". It also has an object name `"importTemplateButton"` for potential styling or identification.
- **Optional Label:** Similar to other button widgets, it includes an empty, fixed-width `QLabel` that could be used for future enhancements like status messages.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` that arranges the (empty) label and the button horizontally.
- `self.label`: An empty `QLabel` with a fixed width.
- `self.button`: The `QPushButton` instance with the text "Import LOGIK-PROJEKT Template".

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The `self.button` (a `QPushButton`) emits the standard `clicked()` signal when pressed.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - The `__init__` method accepts an optional `command` argument. If provided, this callable (typically a method from a template management controller) is connected to the button's `clicked` signal. This is the primary mechanism for initiating the template import logic.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to set the `BUTTON_HEIGHT`, ensuring visual consistency with other buttons in the application.
- **`TemplateHandler` (or a dedicated template management controller)**: This widget is a key part of the template management workflow. The `command` passed to its constructor will typically be a method from a `TemplateHandler` class (e.g., `src/core/template_manager/template_handler.py`). This method will be responsible for:
  - Opening a file dialog to allow the user to select a template file.
  - Reading and deserializing the template data.
  - Populating the UI widgets with the loaded template data.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This button provides a clear and intuitive way for users to load existing project configurations. Its prominent labeling and direct connection to the import logic make the template management process straightforward. The design promotes reusability and efficiency in project setup by allowing users to quickly apply predefined settings.
