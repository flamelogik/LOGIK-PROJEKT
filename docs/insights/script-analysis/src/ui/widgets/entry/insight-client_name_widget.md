# Insight: `client_name_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`ClientNameWidget` is a composite `QWidget` consisting of a `QLabel` and a `QLineEdit`. It serves as a standard, user-editable text input field.

## 2. Purpose

This widget is designed to capture the user's input for the "Client Name," which is a fundamental piece of information for the project.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **User Input:** The widget is fully editable, allowing the user to enter the client's name.
- **Data Access:** The entered text can be retrieved using the `get()` method and programmatically set using the `set(value)` method.
- **Placeholder Text:** It displays "Enter Client Name..." as a prompt for the user.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` that arranges the label and entry field horizontally.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Client Name:".
- `self.entry`: The `QLineEdit` instance where the user types the client's name.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QLineEdit` (`self.entry`) emits the `textChanged(const QString &)` signal whenever the user modifies the text. This allows other parts of the application to react to changes in real-time.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `get(self)`: A public method to retrieve the current text.
  - `set(self, value)`: A public method to populate the entry field.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to use the `ENTRY_HEIGHT` constant, ensuring visual consistency.
- **Relationship to `CalculatedNameWidget`**: The value from this widget is a direct input to the logic that generates the final project name displayed in `CalculatedNameWidget`. A parent controller will listen for `textChanged` signals from this widget to trigger an update.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This is a standard and intuitive input field. The placeholder text clearly indicates its purpose. Its contribution to the `CalculatedNameWidget` provides immediate feedback to the user, reinforcing the connection between their input and the final project identifier.
