# Insight: `serial_number_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`SerialNumberWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that contains a `QLabel` and a `QLineEdit`. It is a standard, user-editable text input field for an optional identifier.

## 2. Purpose

This widget is designed to capture an optional serial number or version identifier for the project (e.g., "v01", "003"). This value is often a component of the final project name.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **User Input:** The `QLineEdit` is fully editable by the user.
- **Data Access:** The entered text can be retrieved using the `get()` method and set programmatically using the `set(value)` method.
- **Optionality:** The placeholder text "Enter Serial Number (Optional)..." clearly communicates that this field is not mandatory.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Serial Number:".
- `self.entry`: The `QLineEdit` where the user enters the serial number.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QLineEdit` (`self.entry`) emits the `textChanged(const QString &)` signal. This is key for real-time updates.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `get(self)`: Retrieves the current text.
  - `set(self, value)`: Sets the text.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to use the `ENTRY_HEIGHT` constant for consistent UI styling.
- **Relationship to `CalculatedNameWidget`**: This is a direct and important relationship. A parent controller listens to the `textChanged` signal from this widget's `QLineEdit`. Any change triggers a recalculation and update of the `CalculatedNameWidget`, allowing the user to see the final project name change in real time as they type.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This is a standard optional input field. The placeholder text effectively signals that it can be left blank. Its immediate effect on the `CalculatedNameWidget` provides excellent user feedback, making the naming convention transparent.
