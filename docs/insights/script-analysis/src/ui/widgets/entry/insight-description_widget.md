# Insight: `description_widget.py`

## 1. Widget Type

`DescriptionWidget` is a composite `QWidget` that includes a `QLabel` and a `QLineEdit`. It functions as a standard, user-editable text input field for optional information.

## 2. Purpose

This widget allows the user to enter an optional, free-text description for the project. This information is for descriptive purposes and may not be part of the core project identifier.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **User Input:** The `QLineEdit` is fully editable.
- **Data Access:** The entered text can be retrieved with the `get()` method and set programmatically with the `set(value)` method.
- **Optionality:** The placeholder text "Enter Description (Optional)..." clearly indicates that this field is not mandatory.

## 4. Key Attributes and Properties

- `self.layout`: A `QHBoxLayout` for horizontal arrangement.
- `self.label`: A `QLabel` with the static text "Description:".
- `self.entry`: The `QLineEdit` for user input.

## 5. Signals and Slots

- **Signals:** The underlying `QLineEdit` (`self.entry`) emits the standard `textChanged(const QString &)` signal, allowing other components to monitor its value.
- **Slots (Public Methods):**
  - `get(self)`: Retrieves the current text.
  - `set(self, value)`: Sets the text.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.ui.ui_config`**: Imports `ui_config` to use the `ENTRY_HEIGHT` constant for consistent styling.
- **Relationship to Other Scripts**: Unlike the client or campaign name widgets, the value from the `DescriptionWidget` typically does **not** feed into the `CalculatedNameWidget`. Instead, its value is usually retrieved by a parent controller or `app_logic.py` only when the final project data is being assembled for saving or processing.

## 7. UI/UX Notes

This widget is a standard optional text field. The placeholder text effectively communicates its non-mandatory nature, preventing users from feeling obligated to fill it out. It provides a space for notes or extra context without cluttering the primary project naming scheme.
