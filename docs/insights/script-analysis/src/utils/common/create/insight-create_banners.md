# Insight: `create_banners.py`

## 1. Module Type

`create_banners.py` is a Python utility module. It provides functions for generating formatted text banners.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to create visually consistent banner lines, typically for use in script output, log files, or code comments. These banners help in visually separating sections, emphasizing information, or marking start/end points in text-based outputs.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **`repeat_char(char, count)`:**
  - A simple helper function that repeats a given character `count` times.
- **`make_line_79_chars(line)`:**
  - Ensures that an input `line` string is exactly 79 characters long.
  - It calculates the necessary padding (using '=' characters) to reach 79 characters, inserting it before the " #" suffix.
- **`generate_banner_line(banner)`:**
  - Generates a general banner line with the provided `banner` text centered within a 79-character line, surrounded by '=' characters and prefixed/suffixed with '#'.
  - Utilizes `repeat_char` and `make_line_79_chars`.
- **`generate_banner_line_end(banner_end)`:**
  - Similar to `generate_banner_line`, but specifically for an "end" banner, centering the `banner_end` text.
- **`generate_banner_line_start(banner_start)`:**
  - Similar to `generate_banner_line`, but specifically for a "start" banner, centering the `banner_start` text.

## 4. Key Functions

- `repeat_char(char: str, count: int) -> str`:
  - Purpose: Repeats a character a specified number of times.
- `make_line_79_chars(line: str) -> str`:
  - Purpose: Pads a string with '=' characters to ensure it is exactly 79 characters long.
- `generate_banner_line(banner: str) -> str`:
  - Purpose: Creates a general, centered banner line.
- `generate_banner_line_end(banner_end: str) -> str`:
  - Purpose: Creates a centered banner line specifically for marking the end of a section.
- `generate_banner_line_start(banner_start: str) -> str`:
  - Purpose: Creates a centered banner line specifically for marking the start of a section.

## 5. Signals and Slots

This module is a pure utility module and does not interact with PySide6. Therefore, it does not define or use any signals or slots.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **Standard Python Libraries:** None beyond basic string operations.
- **Relationship to Other Scripts:** This module is designed to be imported and used by other Python scripts within the LOGIK-PROJEKT to generate consistent visual output. It promotes a standardized look and feel for console messages and comments across the project.

## 7. Other Useful Information

- **Code Readability:** The banners generated by this module significantly improve the readability of script outputs and code, making it easier to follow execution flow or identify different sections.
- **Maintainability:** Centralizing banner generation ensures that any changes to the banner style (e.g., length, character used) can be made in one place and propagate throughout the project.
- **Simplicity:** The functions are simple and focused, making them easy to understand and use.
