# Insight: `export_session_variables.py`

## 1. Module Type

`export_session_variables.py` is a Python utility script designed for exporting session-specific project data.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to take a dictionary containing the current project's summary data and save it as a JSON file named `current_session-variables.json` in the `pref/session-preferences` directory. This file acts as a persistent record of the session's variables, which can be used by other parts of the application or for debugging.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **`export_session_variables(projekt_summary_data)`:**
  - Takes a dictionary `projekt_summary_data` as input, which is expected to contain all relevant project configuration details for the current session.
  - Defines the output directory as `pref/session-preferences` and the output filename as `current_session-variables.json`.
  - Ensures the output directory exists using `os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)`.
  - Writes the `projekt_summary_data` dictionary to the specified JSON file with an indent of 4 for readability.
  - Prints a success message to the console upon successful export or an error message if the export fails.

## 4. Key Functions

- `export_session_variables(projekt_summary_data: dict) -> None`:
  - Purpose: Exports the current project's summary data to a JSON file.
  - Arguments: `projekt_summary_data` (a dictionary containing all project configuration data for the session).
  - Returns: None.

## 5. Signals and Slots

This module is a pure utility function and does not interact with PySide6 signals or slots.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **Standard Python Libraries:** `json` (for JSON serialization), `os` (for file system operations).
- **Relationship to Project Creation Workflow:** This function is typically called early in the project creation or setup process (e.g., by `projekt_creator.py`) to capture the state of the project's configuration at that moment. This snapshot can be useful for subsequent steps or for auditing.
- **Relationship to Session Management:** The output file `current_session-variables.json` suggests its role in managing the state and variables of the current application session.

## 7. Other Useful Information

- **Debugging and Auditing:** The generated JSON file provides a human-readable snapshot of all project variables, which is invaluable for debugging issues or auditing the configuration of a created project.
- **Data Persistence:** While primarily for session variables, this mechanism allows for simple persistence of complex dictionary structures to disk.
- **Simplicity:** The function is straightforward, focusing solely on writing the provided dictionary to a JSON file, making it easy to understand and maintain.
