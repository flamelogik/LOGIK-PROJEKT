# Insight: `get_flame_software_versions.py`

## 1. Module Type

`get_flame_software_versions.py` is a Python utility module. It provides a single function to retrieve a list of installed Autodesk Flame family software versions.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to act as a simple wrapper or accessor for the functionality provided by `flame_software_utils.py`. It makes the process of getting available Flame versions straightforward for other parts of the application, particularly for populating UI elements.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Delegated Logic:** The `get_flame_software_versions()` function directly calls `get_installed_flame_versions()` from the `flame_software_utils` module. It does not contain any complex logic itself; it merely exposes the functionality of its dependency.
- **Return Value:** It returns a list of strings, where each string represents an installed Flame, Flare, or Flame Assist version (e.g., `["Flame 2025.1", "Flare 2025.1"]`).

## 4. Key Functions

- `get_flame_software_versions() -> list[str]`:
  - Purpose: Retrieves the list of installed Autodesk Flame software versions.
  - Returns: A list of strings, each representing an installed software version.

## 5. Signals and Slots

This module is a pure utility module and does not interact with PySide6. Therefore, it does not define or use any signals or slots.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **`src.core.utils.flame_software_utils`:** This module is directly dependent on `flame_software_utils.py`, which contains the actual logic for scanning the system and identifying installed Flame software versions.
- **`src.ui.panels.flame_options_panel.py`:** This module is used by `FlameOptionsPanel` to populate the `FlameSoftwareChoiceWidget`'s options. The `FlameOptionsPanel` calls `get_flame_software_versions()` and then passes the returned list to the `set_values()` method of its `FlameSoftwareChoiceWidget` instance.

## 7. Other Useful Information

- **Abstraction:** This module provides a clean abstraction layer, allowing UI components to easily get the list of Flame versions without needing to know the underlying system-scanning logic.
- **Modularity:** It adheres to the principle of single responsibility, making the codebase cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Dynamic UI Population:** Enables the application to dynamically present available Flame versions to the user, adapting to the specific software installed on their system.
