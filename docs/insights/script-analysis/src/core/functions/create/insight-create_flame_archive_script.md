# Insight: `create_flame_archive_script.py`

## 1. Module Type

`create_flame_archive_script.py` is a Python utility module. It is designed to generate shell scripts for automating Autodesk Flame project archiving and crontab entries for scheduling these archives.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the automated backup and archiving of Flame projects. It creates two main files:
1.  A shell script that performs the actual Flame project archiving using Flame's internal tools.
2.  A shell script that helps in adding the archive script to the system's crontab for scheduled execution.

## 3. Behavior and Functionality

- **Directory Creation:** It creates necessary directories for storing the generated archive scripts within the LOGIK-PROJEKT structure (e.g., `logik_projekt_path/flame/archive/scripts/`).
- **Template Reading and Replacement:** It reads content from predefined template files (`archive_script_template` and `archive_script_to_crontab_template.sh`). It then performs string replacements on these templates using project-specific data (e.g., project names, workstation name, paths) provided in the `projekt_summary_data` dictionary.
- **Script Generation:** It writes the modified template content to new `.sh` files, creating the executable archive script and the crontab setup script.
- **Permissions:** It sets executable permissions (`0o755`) on the generated shell scripts, making them ready for execution.
- **Logging:** It uses the `logging` module to provide informative messages about the script creation process, including success messages and the paths of the generated files.

## 4. Key Functions

- `create_flame_archive_script(projekt_summary_data: dict)`:
  - Purpose: Generates the Flame project archive shell script and the crontab entry script.
  - Arguments: `projekt_summary_data` (a dictionary containing all necessary project details like names, paths, and workstation information).
  - Behavior: Reads templates, performs string replacements, writes new executable scripts, and logs the process.

## 5. Signals and Slots

This module is a pure utility module and does not interact with PySide6. Therefore, it does not define or use any signals or slots.

## 6. Dependencies and Relationships

- **Standard Python Libraries:** `os`, `logging`, `datetime`, `shutil`.
- **External Templates:** It relies on external template files located in `cfg/site-cfg/flame-cfg/flame-templates/flame-archive-templates/`.
- **`projekt_summary_data`:** This module is heavily dependent on the `projekt_summary_data` dictionary, which is typically assembled by the main application logic (`AppLogic`) from various UI inputs and system information.
- **Relationship to Project Creation Workflow:** This script is called as part of the overall project creation process (e.g., by `projekt_creator.py`) to set up automated archiving for the newly created Flame project.
- **External `crontab` Utility:** The generated crontab script is designed to interact with the system's `crontab` utility, implying a dependency on Unix-like operating systems.

## 7. Other Useful Information

- **Automation of Maintenance:** This script automates a critical maintenance task (archiving), which is essential for data management and disaster recovery in production environments.
- **Customization:** The use of templates and string replacement makes the generated scripts highly customizable based on the specific project and environment details.
- **System Integration:** The ability to generate crontab entries allows for seamless integration with system-level scheduling, enabling hands-off automated backups.
- **Security Considerations:** Since it generates and sets executable permissions on shell scripts, proper validation of input data (though not directly handled within this module) is crucial to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
