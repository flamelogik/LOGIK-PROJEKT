# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/get/get_resolution_values.py`

## Overview
The `get_resolution_values.py` script defines a function to retrieve a list of resolution values from multiple JSON configuration files. It reads a specified load order file to determine which resolution JSON files to process, and then extracts resolution data from them, typically used for UI population.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `json`, `os`
- **Local Modules (src.core.functions.get)**:
    - `src.core.functions.get.get_application_paths.GetApplicationPaths`: A class providing centralized paths to application resources.

## Function: `get_resolution_values() -> list[dict]`

### Purpose
To provide a standardized and ordered way to access predefined resolution values from various configuration files, allowing for flexible and extensible resolution definitions.

### Arguments
None.

### Logic
1.  **Define Paths**: Retrieves the base `resolution_path` and the `load_order_file` path from `GetApplicationPaths`.
2.  **Initialize List**: Initializes an empty list `resolutions` to store the extracted resolution data.
3.  **Load Order File**: Attempts to open and load the JSON data from `load_order_file`. This file is expected to contain a list of filenames for individual resolution configuration JSONs.
4.  **Process Resolution Files**: 
    - Iterates through each `filename` in the `load_order` list.
    - Constructs the `json_file_path` by joining `resolution_path` with the `filename`.
    - Checks if `json_file_path` exists.
    - If it exists, reads and parses the JSON data from that file.
    - Extracts resolution items: It expects the JSON data to have an `"items"` key, which contains a list of `item_group`s, each potentially having its own `"items"` list. It then iterates through these nested lists to find dictionaries with a `"resolution_name"` key, appending these dictionaries to the `resolutions` list.
5.  **Return**: Returns the compiled `resolutions` list.

### Returns
- `list[dict]`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a resolution with at least a `"resolution_name"` key. Returns an empty list if any file is not found, is malformed, or an unexpected error occurs.

### Error Handling
- Catches `FileNotFoundError`: If the `load_order_file` or any of the individual resolution JSON files are not found. Prints an error message and returns an empty list.
- Catches `json.JSONDecodeError`: If the `load_order_file` or any of the individual resolution JSON files contain invalid JSON. Prints an error message and returns an empty list.
- Catches general `Exception`: Catches any other unexpected errors during the process. Prints an error message and returns an empty list.

## Observations
- This function provides a highly flexible system for managing resolution data, allowing resolutions to be defined across multiple JSON files and loaded in a specific order.
- The nested structure of the JSON parsing (`"items"` within `"items"`) suggests a hierarchical organization of resolution data.
- The error handling is robust, covering common file and JSON parsing issues.
- The use of `print` for error messages is suitable for a utility function but might be integrated with a more formal `logging` system for production environments.
- This function is crucial for populating resolution selection UI elements, ensuring users have access to a comprehensive and configurable list of options.
