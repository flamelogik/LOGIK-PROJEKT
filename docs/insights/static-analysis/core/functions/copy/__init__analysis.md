# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/copy/__init__.py`

## Overview
This file serves as the package initializer for the `copy` functions directory.

## Dependencies
- **Local Modules (src.core.functions.copy)**:
    - `copy_current_session_files`
    - `copy_flame_bookmarks`
    - `copy_flame_presets`
    - `copy_flame_python_scripts`

## Observations
This file serves as the package initializer for the `copy` functions directory. It imports specific functions to make them directly accessible when the `copy` package is imported, and defines `__all__` to control what is exposed when `from .copy import *` is used.
