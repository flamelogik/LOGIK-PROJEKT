# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/copy/copy_flame_bookmarks.py`

## Overview
The `copy_flame_bookmarks.py` script defines a function to copy the `cf_bookmarks.json` file to a specified destination directory. This ensures consistent Flame project configurations by replicating bookmark settings.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `os`, `shutil`, `logging`

## Function: `copy_flame_bookmarks(source_path: str, destination_dir: str)`

### Purpose
To copy a Flame bookmarks JSON file from a source location to a target directory, typically within a Flame project's setup structure.

### Arguments
- `source_path` (str): The absolute path to the source `cf_bookmarks.json` file.
- `destination_dir` (str): The absolute path to the destination directory (e.g., `flame_projekt_setups_dir/status/`).

### Logic
1.  **Create Destination Directory**: Ensures the `destination_dir` exists, creating it and any necessary parent directories if they don't (`os.makedirs(destination_dir, exist_ok=True)`).
2.  **Construct Destination Path**: Builds the full path for the copied file by joining `destination_dir` with the base name of the `source_path`.
3.  **Copy File**: Uses `shutil.copy2(source_path, destination_path)` to copy the file, preserving metadata.
4.  **Log Success**: Logs an informational message indicating successful copying, including source and destination paths.

### Error Handling
- Catches `FileNotFoundError` if the `source_path` does not exist, logs an error, and re-raises the exception.
- Catches a general `Exception` for any other unexpected errors during the copy process, logs the error, and re-raises the exception.

## Observations
- This function is a straightforward utility for file copying, specifically tailored for Flame's bookmark files.
- The use of `shutil.copy2` is appropriate as it attempts to preserve file metadata, which can be important for configuration files.
- Robust error handling ensures that issues like missing source files or permission problems are caught and reported.
- The function relies on absolute paths for both source and destination, making it explicit and less prone to relative path issues.
