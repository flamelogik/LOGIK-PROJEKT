# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/create/create_projekt_pgsql_db.py`

## Overview
The `create_projekt_pgsql_db.py` script defines a function intended to initialize a PostgreSQL database for a project. Currently, the function serves as a placeholder, providing commented-out examples of how database creation or connection could be implemented.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `os`, `logging`, `sys`
- **Potential External Libraries (commented-out examples)**: `psycopg2`, `subprocess`

## Function: `create_projekt_pgsql_db(logik_projekt_name: str, logik_projekt_path: str)`

### Purpose
To create or connect to a PostgreSQL database specifically for a LOGIK-PROJEKT project, enabling the storage and management of project-specific data within a relational database.

### Arguments
- `logik_projekt_name` (str): The name of the project, which would typically be used as the database name.
- `logik_projekt_path` (str): The path to the LOGIK-PROJEKT directory, where database data could potentially be stored (for self-contained database clusters).

### Logic
1.  **Logging**: Logs an informational message indicating an attempt to create a PostgreSQL database for the specified project.
2.  **Placeholder Implementation**: The current implementation explicitly states that the "Database creation step is currently a placeholder and has been skipped." This means no actual database operations are performed when this function is called.
3.  **Commented-out Example Logic**: The script contains two main commented-out examples demonstrating potential implementations:
    -   **Example 1: Connecting to an existing PostgreSQL service**:
        -   Uses `psycopg2` (a PostgreSQL adapter for Python) to connect to a default PostgreSQL database (e.g., `postgres`).
        -   Sets the isolation level to `ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT`.
        -   Executes a `CREATE DATABASE` SQL command, safely quoting the database name using `psycopg2.sql.Identifier`.
        -   Includes error handling for `psycopg2.errors.DuplicateDatabase` (if the database already exists), `psycopg2.OperationalError` (for connection issues), and general `Exception`.
        -   Ensures the database connection is closed in a `finally` block.
    -   **Example 2: Initializing a new DB cluster in the project path**:
        -   Uses `subprocess` to execute the `initdb` command (a PostgreSQL utility) to initialize a new database cluster within a `db_data` subdirectory of the `logik_projekt_path`.
        -   Includes checks for `initdb` command existence and handles `subprocess.CalledProcessError` for command execution failures.

### Error Handling
- In its current placeholder state, the function logs a general informational message.
- The commented-out example logic includes robust error handling for database-specific errors (e.g., connection issues, duplicate database names) and general exceptions.

## Observations
- This script clearly outlines a significant planned feature for the LOGIK-PROJEKT application: integration with PostgreSQL for project data management.
- The two commented-out examples provide valuable insights into different strategies for database interaction (connecting to an existing service vs. creating a self-contained cluster).
- The emphasis on secure credential management (not hardcoding) in the comments is a good practice reminder.
- The script highlights the need for external PostgreSQL installation and configuration for this feature to become active.
- The current placeholder status indicates that this is a feature under active development or consideration.
