# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/create/create_projekt_launcher_alias.py`

## Overview
The `create_projekt_launcher_alias.py` script defines a function intended to create a shell alias for launching a Flame project. Currently, the core logic for alias creation is commented out, and the function serves as a placeholder.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `os`, `logging`, `sys`, `pathlib`

## Function: `create_projekt_launcher_alias(alias_name: str, launcher_script_path: str)`

### Purpose
To provide a simplified command-line interface for users to launch their Flame projects by creating a shell alias that points to the project's launcher script.

### Arguments
- `alias_name` (str): The desired name for the shell alias (e.g., `'start_my_projekt'`).
- `launcher_script_path` (str): The absolute path to the Flame project's launcher script that the alias will execute.

### Logic
1.  **Logging**: Logs an informational message indicating an attempt to create the project launcher alias.
2.  **Placeholder Implementation**: The current implementation explicitly states that the "Alias creation step is currently a placeholder and has been skipped." This means no actual alias is created when this function is called.
3.  **Commented-out Example Logic**: The script contains extensive commented-out code that demonstrates how the alias creation *could* be implemented. This includes:
    -   Detecting the user's shell (`bash` or `zsh`).
    -   Identifying the appropriate shell configuration file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).
    -   Constructing the alias command (e.g., `alias my_alias="bash /path/to/script.sh"`).
    -   Checking if the alias already exists in the configuration file to prevent duplicates.
    -   Appending the new alias to the shell configuration file.
    -   Providing instructions to the user to restart their terminal or source the config file.
    -   Includes error handling for `FileNotFoundError` (if the rc file is missing) and general `Exception`.

### Error Handling
- In its current placeholder state, the function logs a general informational message.
- The commented-out example logic includes robust error handling for file operations and general exceptions during alias creation.

## Observations
- This script is a clear example of a feature that is planned but not yet implemented. The commented-out code serves as a blueprint for future development.
- The design considers different shell environments (`bash`, `zsh`), indicating an intention for cross-platform compatibility.
- The approach of modifying shell RC files directly is a common method for creating persistent aliases, but requires careful handling of file I/O and user permissions.
- The logging is well-integrated, providing feedback on the function's current (placeholder) status.
