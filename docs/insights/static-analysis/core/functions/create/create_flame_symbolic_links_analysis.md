# Static Analysis: `src/core/functions/create/create_flame_symbolic_links.py`

## Overview
The `create_flame_symbolic_links.py` script defines a function to establish symbolic links between LOGIK-PROJEKT directories and Autodesk Flame project setup directories. This integration allows Flame to access resources (scripts, presets, templates) from the LOGIK-PROJEKT structure and also links iteration directories.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `os`, `logging`, `time`
- **Local Modules (src.core.utils)**:
    - `src.core.utils.path_utils`

## Function: `create_flame_symbolic_links(logik_projekt_path: str, flame_projekt_setups_dir: str, current_workstation: str)`

### Purpose
To create a set of symbolic links that integrate LOGIK-PROJEKT resources into a Flame project's environment and establish a link for iteration directories.

### Arguments
- `logik_projekt_path` (str): The absolute path to the LOGIK-PROJEKT directory.
- `flame_projekt_setups_dir` (str): The absolute path to the Flame project's `setups` directory.
- `current_workstation` (str): The name of the current workstation.

### Logic
1.  **Logging**: Logs an informational message indicating the start of symbolic link creation.
2.  **Standard Links**: 
    - Defines a list `links_to_create` containing tuples of `(source_relative_path, destination_name)` for common LOGIK-PROJEKT resources (scripts, presets, templates).
    - Iterates through this list:
        - Constructs the `source_path` by joining the project root (obtained via `path_utils.get_repository_root_dir()`) with `source_relative`.
        - Constructs the `destination_path` by joining `flame_projekt_setups_dir` with `destination_name`.
        - **Link Creation Logic**:
            - Checks if `source_path` exists.
            - If `source_path` exists and `destination_path` does not exist or is not already a correct symlink, it creates a symbolic link using `os.symlink()`.
            - Logs success, or warnings if the source is missing, or if the destination already exists and is not a correct symlink.
        - Includes error handling for `OSError` and general `Exception` during symlink creation.
3.  **Iteration Directory Link**:
    - Constructs `source_path_iterations` (e.g., `logik_projekt_path/flame/iterations`).
    - Constructs `destination_path_iterations` (e.g., `flame_projekt_setups_dir/batch/flame/iterations`).
    - Applies the same link creation and error handling logic as for standard links.
4.  **Flame Setups Directory Link (with Retries)**:
    - Constructs `source_path_setups` as `flame_projekt_setups_dir`.
    - Constructs `destination_path_setups` (e.g., `logik_projekt_path/flame/setups/current_workstation/setups`).
    - Ensures the parent directory of `destination_path_setups` exists.
    - Implements a retry mechanism (up to `max_retries = 5`) with a `retry_delay` for creating this specific symlink.
    - The retry loop attempts to create the symlink, handling `OSError` (e.g., if the directory is still being created by another process) and logging progress/errors.
    - Logs detailed information about source/destination paths and their existence during the process.

### Error Handling
- Catches `OSError` for file system-related errors during symlink creation.
- Catches general `Exception` for other unexpected errors.
- Logs informational messages for successful link creation, warnings for missing sources or existing/incorrect destinations, and errors for failures.

## Observations
- This script is critical for integrating the LOGIK-PROJEKT structure with Flame's expected directory layout, particularly for shared resources and iteration management.
- The use of `os.symlink()` is appropriate for creating lightweight links to directories.
- The detailed checks for existing files/symlinks at the destination prevent errors and provide informative logging.
- The retry mechanism for the Flame setups directory link is a robust solution for potential race conditions or temporary file system issues during project creation.
- The script relies on `path_utils.get_repository_root_dir()` to correctly locate source directories.
