# Static Analysis: `src/core/utils/custom_filesystem_tools/directory_structure_to_bookmarks.py`

## Overview
The `directory_structure_to_bookmarks.py` script defines a function `directory_structure_to_bookmarks` that converts a flat, pipe-separated list of directory structure data (typically generated by `directory_structure_analysis.py`) into a nested JSON file formatted specifically for Autodesk Flame's bookmark system. It dynamically constructs Flame-specific paths and organizes directories into a hierarchical structure.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `json`, `os`

## Function: `directory_structure_to_bookmarks(data_file, output_file, original_path=None, project_nickname=None)`

### Purpose
To generate a valid Autodesk Flame bookmark JSON file from a simplified directory structure analysis, allowing users to quickly create Flame project bookmarks that mirror their file system organization.

### Arguments
- `data_file` (str): The path to the temporary file containing the directory structure data (output of `directory_structure_analysis.py`).
- `output_file` (str): The absolute path to the JSON file where the Flame bookmarks will be saved.
- `original_path` (str, optional): The original root path that was analyzed. Used for constructing Flame paths.
- `project_nickname` (str, optional): A nickname for the project, used in constructing Flame paths.

### Logic
1.  **Initialization**: Sets a default `project_nickname` if none is provided. Reads the `data_file` (expected to be the output of `directory_structure_analysis.py`), extracting the `root_dir_name` and `subdir_count` from the first two lines.
2.  **Collect Structure Data**: Iterates through the remaining lines of the `data_file`:
    -   Parses each line, splitting by `"|"` to get `subdir`, `has_children_flag`, and `parent_name`.
    -   Determines if the entry represents a folder or a bookmark based on `has_children_flag`.
    -   **Flame Path Construction**: Constructs the Flame-specific path (`/PROJEKTS/{project_nickname}/{subdir}`). It handles cases where `subdir` might be the root directory name itself and ensures consistent forward slashes for Windows compatibility.
    -   Stores this processed information (type, path, parent, name) in a `structure` dictionary, keyed by the `subdir`.
3.  **`output_bookmarks_structure()` (Nested Helper Function)**:
    -   This recursive function is responsible for building the nested `Bookmarks` array required by the Flame JSON format.
    -   It iterates through the `structure` dictionary, identifying children that belong to the current `key` (parent).
    -   If an entry is a `"folder"`, it recursively calls itself to populate the `Bookmarks` list for that folder.
    -   If an entry is a `"bookmark"`, it creates a simple bookmark entry with `Bookmark`, `Path`, and a hardcoded `"Visibility": "Global"`.
    -   Returns the constructed list of bookmarks/folders.
4.  **Create Base JSON Structure**: Initializes a `json_data` dictionary with the standard `DlBookmark` structure, including predefined sections and bookmarks (e.g., `"flame setups"`, `"PROJEKTS"`, `"projekt home"`). It includes a placeholder `"projekt directories"` folder with an empty `Bookmarks` list.
5.  **Populate `"projekt directories"`**: Calls `output_bookmarks_structure()` with the `root_dir_name` to recursively populate the `Bookmarks` list within the `"projekt directories"` folder in `json_data`.
6.  **Write JSON Output**: Writes the final `json_data` to the `output_file` in a pretty-printed JSON format (`indent=4`).

### Observations
-   This script is highly specialized for generating Autodesk Flame bookmark files, demonstrating a deep understanding of Flame's expected JSON structure.
-   It acts as a crucial bridge between a generic file system analysis and a specific application's configuration format.
-   The recursive `output_bookmarks_structure` function is essential for building the hierarchical structure required by Flame's bookmarks.
-   The dynamic path construction, including handling of the `project_nickname` and path separators, is a key feature.
-   The script includes debug `print` statements, which are useful during development but should ideally be removed or integrated with a proper logging system in a production environment.
-   Error handling for file operations (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) is not explicitly present within the main function, implying that the calling context is responsible for catching these.
