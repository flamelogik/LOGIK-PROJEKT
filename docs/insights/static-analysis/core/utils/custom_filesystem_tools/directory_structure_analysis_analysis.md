# Static Analysis: `src/core/utils/custom_filesystem_tools/directory_structure_analysis.py`

## Overview
The `directory_structure_analysis.py` script defines a function `directory_structure_analysis` that recursively traverses a given root directory, analyzes its subdirectory structure, and outputs a formatted summary to a temporary file. The analysis includes relative paths, whether a directory has children, and its parent directory's name. It specifically handles hidden directories and sorts the output naturally.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `os`, `re` (for natural sorting)

## Function: `directory_structure_analysis()`

### Purpose
To generate a structured representation of a file system directory, which can then be used for various purposes such as creating bookmarks, generating JSON representations, or for documentation.

### Signature
`def directory_structure_analysis(root_dir, tmp_file):`

### Logic
1.  **Initialization**: Initializes `parent_dir_name` from the `root_dir`, an empty list `subdirs` to store relative paths, and dictionaries `has_children` and `parents` to track directory relationships.
2.  **Directory Traversal**: Uses `os.walk(root_dir)` to traverse the directory tree.
    -   It skips the `root_dir` itself.
    -   For each `dirpath` (current directory being walked):
        -   Calculates `rel_path` relative to `root_dir`.
        -   **Hidden Directory Handling**: If the base name of `rel_path` starts with `.`, it's considered a hidden directory. `dirnames[:] = []` is used to prevent `os.walk` from descending into its subdirectories.
        -   Appends `rel_path` to `subdirs`.
        -   Determines `parent_path` and `parent_name`.
        -   Calculates `depth` of the subdirectory.
        -   Populates the `parents` dictionary: For root-level subdirectories, the parent is `"projekt directories"` (if depth is 0) or an empty string (if `parent_path` is `.` and `depth` is not 0). For other subdirectories, the parent is `parent_name`.
        -   If `parent_path` exists and is not `.` (current directory), it marks `parent_path` in `has_children` as `True`.
3.  **Natural Sorting**: The `subdirs` list is sorted using a custom `key` function that implements natural sorting (handles numbers within strings correctly) using `re.split(r'(\d+)', s)`.
4.  **Write to Temporary File**: Opens `tmp_file` in write mode (`'w'`).
    -   Writes the `parent_dir_name` and the count of `subdirs` to the file.
    -   Iterates through the sorted `subdirs`:
        -   Determines `has_children_flag` (`"true"` or `"false"`).
        -   Retrieves the `parent` name from the `parents` dictionary.
        -   Writes a formatted line to the file: `subdir|has_children_flag|parent\n`.

### Observations
-   This function is a core utility for understanding and representing the file system structure in a structured, text-based format.
-   The handling of hidden directories is important for avoiding irrelevant data and potential issues.
-   Natural sorting ensures that directory listings are presented in a human-friendly order.
-   The output format (pipe-separated values) is simple and can be easily parsed by other scripts or tools.
-   The function directly writes to a temporary file, implying that the output is intended for immediate consumption by another process or for intermediate storage.
-   The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block provides a command-line interface for testing the function independently.
