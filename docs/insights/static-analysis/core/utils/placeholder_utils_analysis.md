# Static Analysis: `src/core/utils/placeholder_utils.py`

## Overview
The `placeholder_utils.py` script defines a function `replace_placeholders` that is designed to substitute placeholder strings within a given path string with their corresponding values from a dictionary. It handles nested placeholders by iteratively replacing them until no more known placeholders are found, or a maximum iteration limit is reached to prevent infinite loops.

## Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: `re` (for regular expressions, specifically `re.escape` and `re.search`)

## Function: `replace_placeholders()`

### Purpose
To dynamically construct file paths or other strings by replacing symbolic placeholders (e.g., `<project name>`) with actual values, supporting scenarios where one placeholder's value might contain another placeholder.

### Signature
`def replace_placeholders(path_string: str, placeholder_values: dict) -> str:`

### Logic
1.  **Initialization**: `resolved_path` is initialized with the input `path_string`. A `max_iterations` is set to `10` to prevent infinite loops in case of circular references or unresolvable placeholders.
2.  **Iterative Replacement**: The function enters a `for` loop that runs up to `max_iterations` times.
    -   Inside the loop, a `found_placeholder` flag is set to `False` at the beginning of each iteration.
    -   It then iterates through each `placeholder, value` pair in the `placeholder_values` dictionary.
    -   `re.escape(placeholder)` is used to escape any special characters in the `placeholder` string, ensuring that `re.search` treats the placeholder as a literal string rather than a regular expression pattern.
    -   `re.search(pattern, resolved_path)` checks if the current `placeholder` exists in the `resolved_path`.
    -   If a `placeholder` is found, `resolved_path.replace(placeholder, value)` performs the substitution, and `found_placeholder` is set to `True`.
    -   After iterating through all `placeholder_values` in a single pass, if `found_placeholder` is still `False`, it means no more known placeholders were found in the `resolved_path`, so the loop breaks.
3.  **Return Value**: The final `resolved_path` string, with all resolvable placeholders replaced, is returned.

### Observations
-   This function is a versatile utility for dynamic string manipulation, particularly useful for constructing paths or commands where parts of the string are variable.
-   The iterative approach effectively handles nested placeholders, which is a common requirement in complex configuration systems.
-   The `max_iterations` safeguard is a good practice to prevent runaway processes in the event of malformed `placeholder_values` (e.g., `{"A": "<B>", "B": "<A>"}`).
-   The use of `re.escape` is crucial for correctly handling placeholders that might contain regular expression metacharacters.
-   The function does not report which placeholders, if any, could not be resolved, which might be a useful enhancement for debugging.
