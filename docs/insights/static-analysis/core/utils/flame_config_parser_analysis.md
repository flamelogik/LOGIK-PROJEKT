# Static Analysis: `src/core/utils/flame_config_parser.py`

## Overview
The `flame_config_parser.py` script defines a function `parse_flame_config` that is intended to parse configuration content related to Autodesk Flame. As of the current implementation, it serves as a placeholder, demonstrating a very basic key-value parsing logic. **Note**: This parser is currently too simplistic for complex Flame configuration files like `sysconfig.cfg`, which are JSON-formatted.

## Dependencies
- None (uses basic string operations)

## Function: `parse_flame_config()`

### Purpose
To convert a string containing Flame configuration data into a Python dictionary. The current implementation is a simplified example, and the docstring indicates it would require more sophisticated parsing logic for actual Flame configuration formats.

### Signature
`def parse_flame_config(config_content: str) -> dict:`

### Logic
1.  **Print Message**: Prints "Parsing Flame config content..." to the console.
2.  **Initialize Dictionary**: An empty dictionary `parsed_data` is created to store the parsed key-value pairs.
3.  **Line-by-Line Parsing**: Iterates through each line of the `config_content` string.
    -   For each `line`, it checks if a colon (`:`) is present.
    -   If a colon is found, the line is split into a `key` and `value` at the first colon.
    -   Both `key` and `value` are stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
    -   The `key`-`value` pair is added to the `parsed_data` dictionary.
4.  **Return Parsed Data**: The `parsed_data` dictionary is returned.

### Observations
-   This function is a very basic parser. It assumes a simple `key: value` format per line.
-   The docstring explicitly states that this is a placeholder and would need actual parsing logic based on the real Flame configuration format, which is likely more complex (e.g., XML, INI, or a custom format).
-   The `print` statement is useful for debugging but should ideally be replaced with a proper logging mechanism in a production environment.
-   The function does not include any error handling for malformed lines (e.g., lines without a colon) or duplicate keys; it would simply overwrite previous values for duplicate keys.
-   This function would need significant expansion to be truly useful for parsing complex Flame configuration files like `sysconfig.cfg` (which is noted as a JSON file in `GEMINI.md`).
