# Static Analysis: `src/ui/widgets/button/create_projekt_widget.py`

## Overview
The `CreateProjektWidget` class is a custom `QWidget` (from PySide6) designed to provide a button for initiating the creation of a LOGIK-PROJEKT. It consists of an optional `QLabel` (currently empty) and a `QPushButton` labeled "Create LOGIK-PROJEKT". It allows for a command to be connected to its `clicked` signal during initialization.

## Dependencies
- **PySide6.QtWidgets**: `QWidget`, `QPushButton`, `QHBoxLayout`, `QLabel`
- **PySide6.QtCore**: `Qt` (for alignment flags)
- **Local Modules (src.ui)**:
    - `src.ui.ui_config`: Used for setting the fixed height of the button (`BUTTON_HEIGHT`).

## Class: `CreateProjektWidget`

### Purpose
To provide a clear and actionable UI element for users to trigger the project creation process within the application.

### Initialization (`__init__`)
- Inherits from `PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget`.
- Takes `master` (parent widget) and an optional `command` (a callable) as arguments.
- Initializes an `QHBoxLayout` for the widget, setting its contents margins to zero.
- Creates a `QLabel` (currently with empty text) and sets its alignment to right and vertically center. It also sets a fixed width of 160 pixels.
    - Adds the label to the layout.
- Creates a `QPushButton` with the text "Create LOGIK-PROJEKT".
    - Sets the object name to "createProjektButton" for QSS (Qt Style Sheet) styling.
    - Sets a fixed height for the button using `ui_config.BUTTON_HEIGHT`.
    - If a `command` is provided during initialization, it connects the button's `clicked` signal to this `command`.
    - Adds the button to the layout.

### Methods
- This widget does not expose explicit `get()` or `set()` methods for its value, as its primary function is to trigger an action.

## Observations
- This widget is a self-contained UI component for a specific action.
- The `QLabel` is present but empty, suggesting it might be a placeholder for future use or a design choice to maintain consistent layout structure with other widgets that do have labels.
- The use of `ui_config.BUTTON_HEIGHT` ensures consistent sizing across similar button widgets in the application.
- The ability to pass a `command` during initialization makes this widget reusable and flexible for different actions, although in `AppWindow` the connection is made externally.
- The `setObjectName` is used for styling, allowing for custom visual appearance via QSS.
