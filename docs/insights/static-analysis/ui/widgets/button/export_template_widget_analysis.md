# Static Analysis: `src/ui/widgets/button/export_template_widget.py`

## Overview
The `ExportTemplateWidget` class is a custom `QWidget` (from PySide6) that provides a button to initiate the template export process. It consists of a `QLabel` (currently empty but with a fixed width) and a `QPushButton` labeled "Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template".

## Dependencies
- **PySide6.QtWidgets**: `QWidget`, `QPushButton`, `QHBoxLayout`, `QLabel`
- **PySide6.QtCore**: `Qt` (for alignment flags)
- **Local Modules (src.ui)**:
    - `src.ui.ui_config`: Used for setting the fixed height of the button (`BUTTON_HEIGHT`).

## Class: `ExportTemplateWidget`

### Purpose
To provide a clear and actionable button for users to trigger the template export workflow, allowing them to save their current project settings as a reusable template.

### Initialization (`__init__`)
- Inherits from `PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget`.
- Takes `master` (parent widget) and an optional `command` (a callable function) as arguments.
- Initializes an `QHBoxLayout` for the widget, setting its contents margins to zero.
- Creates a `QLabel` (initially empty) with right and vertical center alignment, and a fixed width of 160 pixels. This label appears to be a placeholder or intended for future use.
- Creates a `QPushButton` with the text "Export LOGIK-PROJEKT Template".
    - Sets its object name to "exportTemplateButton" for potential styling or identification.
    - Sets a fixed height for the button using `ui_config.BUTTON_HEIGHT`.
- If a `command` is provided during initialization, it connects the button's `clicked` signal to this `command` callable, allowing external logic to be executed when the button is pressed.
- Adds both the label and the button to the layout.

### Methods
- This widget does not define any public methods beyond its constructor, as its primary function is to provide a clickable button that emits a signal.

## Observations
- This widget is a simple, reusable button component.
- The `command` parameter in the constructor makes it highly flexible, allowing any callable to be connected to the button's click event without subclassing.
- The use of `ui_config.BUTTON_HEIGHT` ensures consistent button sizing across the application.
- The empty `QLabel` with a fixed width suggests a design choice to maintain layout consistency, even if no text is currently displayed next to the button.
